# Basic-MEAN-framework

## Introduction
This is a very basic framework for MEAN. I wanna to build this example for future development, and get familar with a logic folder structure,
as well as angular, express.
All the lib or tools used are:
- Angular 1
- Express
- NodeJS
- Mongodb
  - mongooes
  
## Future's work
For the next half a month, I will build a small project that contains CRUD and MVC structure on branch 'smallproject'

If I got more time(of course I have), I will mainly focus on the extendsion of the small project, including add more modules and ux (using material design).
